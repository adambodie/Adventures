		<h1>Welcome to Adam's Adventures</h1>
		<p>Over the years, I've made numerous trips throughout the U.S. and a few in Europe.  Travelling and photography are two things I've excelled at throughout the years.  It's a true passion I've always held.  Along with my many photos, comes a theathric presentation of said photos.  There's more than showing photos than just showing photos.  That's why I made slideshows of my best trips and photos.  But in this current age, my creativity has evolved beyond great heights.  That doesn't mean I ignore the limitations of the past.  With that said, I have recreated my presentations using modern web-based technologies, all viewable on the web for the first time.  Enjoy!</p>
