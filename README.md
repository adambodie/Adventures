Adam's Adventures
=======================

## Technologies Used

* React
* GatsbyJs
* GraphQL
* Jest
* Sass

### Version 1.0
My initial goal for this project was to build a website containing links to all of my slideshows I had previously made with Microsoft Powerpoint of my various trips between 2003 and 2011.   My first version of the project was built in React, containing a scrollable slider with links to all of my projects underneath the header, with a body containing basic information on the project.  I based my color scheme of the project from a photograph I took whose colors I found to be particularly fascinating.

### Version 2.0
Version 2.0 converted the scrollable slider to a more banner-like appearance, which allowed me to add Redux state management to the array of links.  The color scheme remained the same, but opting to remove the random featured picture, a feature most prominent on my random project component of my portfolio page, this project felt to me it was missing something.

### Version 3.0
It was with Version 3.0 that I saw the full realization of what Adamâ€™s Adventures could become.  Instead of the scrollable slider/banner, I used the paginated gallery of my links to present all of my projects.  Viewing my photo projects like blog posts, I found new ways to make my project function like a blog, including tags.  For the build of this project, I used GatsbyJS as the backbone of my project, along with GraphQL to retrieve the data.  I had only very basic understanding of GraphQL prior to this version of the project, but here I learned a much better understanding of GraphQL.
